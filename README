Cloud Scrubber

Ruby service platform for automatically scrubbing personally identifiable information (PII) or other sensitive information before sending
the data off to a cloud provider (Amazon, etc.) for processing. Handles "unscrubbing" the data when it comes back.

Goal is to provide connectivity to a variety of persistence mechanisms (MongoDB, file system, other databases, memory, etc.) and to support
input from a wide variety of sources (HTTP REST API, RabbitMQ/AMQP, dRb (distributed ruby), named pipes, stdin, etc.).
